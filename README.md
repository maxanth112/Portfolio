<h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio website project! This is a website I made to highlight some of my accomplishments, previous experiences, and some of my interests. 
This project was done in the thick of my 20-credit final semester at CU Boulder while I finished my mathematics and computer
science degrees: so, the code may be messy in places. But creating it was a lot of fun, and I hope you enjoy it. A few things that helped this project come together: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Three.js</li>
    <li>jQuery</li>
    <li>Front-Awesome</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Some good ole-fashion elbow grease</li>
</ul>
