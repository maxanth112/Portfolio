        Analyze existing inventory to determine optimal usage and demand
        levels across all locations. Helped build a new process using existing data to determine
        new requisitions and part levels. Helped identify out of date materials and their locations,
        purged these in the system and from the database to improve overall accuracy. Implemented
        automatically triggered requisitions to sell back unwanted inventory. Organize parts by plane to
        phase out inventory levels for aircrafts reaching retirement. Participated in the implementation of
        uploading new requisitions derived from the new process created.
